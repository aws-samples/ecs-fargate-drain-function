# ecs-fargate-drain-function

Terraform scripts for deploying lambda for de-registering load balancer targets on `FARGATE_SPOT` interruption.

- Lambda function code that is used here is written by @jicowan on issue: https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/797
  Lambda for de-registering tasks: https://gist.github.com/jicowan/ad5e13d12577b41a22f83ed91a3e61bf
- EventBridge rule is created based on: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-capacity-providers.html#fargate-capacity-providers-termination

A deadletter SQS queue is created for failed Lambda executions.

## UPDATE - February 2023: NO LONGER REQUIRED

As of February 2023, Amazon ECS will now deregister your task running on Fargate Spot, if it receives a spot termination notice, before issuing a SIGTERM message to inform the task that it needs to stop. This improvement helps you manage spot interruption of tasks running on the Fargate Spot capacity provider more safely. 

This means that you no longer need to deploy a Lambda like this.

Please see https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/02/amazon-elastic-container-service-accuracy-service-load-balancing/ for more details.

### Overview

All commands are defined in `MakeFile`.
You do not need to have installed `go` or `terraform` environments on your computer.
All commands are executed in inside docker image which needs to be build at the beginning.  

### Init - Build Docker image

At the very beginning we need to build image which will be used laetr for other commands.

Command: `make build` will build local `aws-samples/aws-lambda-deregister-targets-fargate-spot` image. In that image we initialize terraform with our terraform configuration. 
Check `DockerFile` for details.

### Source code compile

To compile your source code, run `make compile`. 
With this command executes `go build` command in docker Go env.
After this command we have new `build/` folder created containing compiled program.
All terrafrom tasks are depending on this one so we do not execute it when runnign `plan` or `apply`

### Terraform commands

`plan`, `apply` and `destroy` are supported terraform commands.
WIth `plan` we will just get output what resources will be created.

In order to run these commands we need to pass AWS acces,secret and region params to make. 

- `make awsDefaultRegion=eu-central-1  awsAccessKey=accessxxx   awsSecretKey=secretxxx plan`
- `make awsDefaultRegion=eu-central-1  awsAccessKey=accessxxx   awsSecretKey=secretxxx apply`
- `make awsDefaultRegion=eu-central-1  awsAccessKey=accessxxx   awsSecretKey=secretxxx destroy`
